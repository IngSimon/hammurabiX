Hammurabi is a HEALPix-based tool for simulating observables such as
polarized synchrotron and thermal dust emission from models of physical inputs such as 
magnetic fields, dust and electron distributions, etc. 
It is a modular C++ framework into which you can add your own models easily 
and then use it to perform the line-of-sight integration to compute the observables. 
See the wiki for installation and usage information. 
Please cite the original Waelkens et al. (2009) paper if you use hammurabi.

This is an internal version open to HAMMURABI/DRAGON/IMAGINE developers only,
for problems please also contact
