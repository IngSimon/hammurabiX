## member list of **``param_breg_unif``**

- **``bp``**
> $$B_p$$, the magnetic field component parallel to the galactic disk.

- **``bv``**
> $$B_v$$, the magnetic field component perpendicular to the galactic disk, pointing towards the northern galactic pole.

- **``l0``**
> $$l_0$$, the galactic longitude, defines the direction of $$B_p$$.

The explicit uniform magnetic field distribution is described within the section 2.2 of:
