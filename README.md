# hammurabi README

hammurabi is an open-source (GNU General Public License v3) HEALPix-based tool 
for simulating full-sky Galactic foreground observables.
Outputs of hammurabi include:

- **polarized synchrotron emission**
- **thermal dust emission** [in progress]
- **dispersion measure** 
- **Faraday depth**

Essential physical inputs/modelings required during simulation include:  

- **Galactic magnetic fields**
- **dust distribution** [in progress]
- **(cosmic-ray/thermal) electron distribution**

hammurabi is a modular C++ framework which is friendly to user defined models.
In version X, we mainly focus on improving its numerical reliablility and scalability.

Please check our [**WIKI PAGE**](https://bitbucket.org/hammurabicode/hamx/wiki/Home) for more detailed technical information.

Original hammurabi source code can be found [**here**](https://sourceforge.net/projects/hammurabicode/).
