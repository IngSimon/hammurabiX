# hammurabi README
##### (current version X.01.00)

hammurabi is an open-source (GNU General Public License v3) HEALPix-based tool
for simulating full-sky observables from Galactic sources.
Products of hammurabi include **polarized synchrotron emission**, **thermal dust emission**, **dispersion measure** and **Faraday depth**.
Corresponding physical inputs/modelings include  **Galactic magnetic fields**, **dust distribution** and **electron distribution**, etc.
hammurabi is a modular C++ framework into which is friendly to user customized models.
In version X, we mainly focus on providing reliable and scalable numerical implementations.
Please check the [wiki page](https://bitbucket.org/hammurabicode/hamx/wiki/Home) for more detailed technical information.

Original hammurabi source code can be found [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/hammurabicode/).

Please cite the original [Waelkens et al. (2009)](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/abs/2009/08/aa10564-08/aa10564-08.html) paper if you use hammurabi.

### version X.01
*Currently we are in [TESTING](./unitest) release,
with only minimal amount of features available.
Not all modelings have been thoroughly cross-checked with original hammurabi!
A full release of version X.02 is scheduled in 2018-2019.*
